MedStat: Professional Medical Statistics & Research Tool
MedStat is a comprehensive, web-based statistical tool designed specifically for medical researchers, clinicians, and biostatisticians. It serves as a powerful, free alternative to SPSS, Stata, and GraphPad, providing advanced analytical capabilities directly in your browser without any installation.

🌟 Key Features
Firth Logistic Regression: Automatically fixes "Complete Separation" errors and reduces bias in small sample sizes (n < 50) or rare event data.

Propensity Score Matching (PSM): Reduce selection bias and confounding in observational studies to mimic randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Survival Analysis: Generate professional Kaplan-Meier curves and perform Cox Proportional Hazards Regression with ease.

Publication-Ready Outputs: Get APA-style tables and high-resolution Forest Plots ready for medical journals.

Data Compatibility: Seamlessly analyze Excel (.xlsx) and CSV files.

🛡️ Privacy & Security (HIPAA Ready)
In medical research, data privacy is paramount.

100% Client-Side Processing: All statistical calculations are performed locally in your browser using JavaScript.

Zero Data Upload: Your sensitive clinical data never leaves your computer and is never stored on our servers.

Security: Ideal for confidential patient data and HIPAA-regulated research.
