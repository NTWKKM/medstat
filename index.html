        <h1>MedStat: Free Alternative to SPSS, Stata, and GraphPad for Medical Research</h1>
        
        <p>MedStat is a comprehensive, free-to-use medical statistics platform designed specifically for researchers, clinicians, biostatisticians, and healthcare professionals. Our tool provides advanced analytical capabilities without the need for expensive software licenses or installation.</p>

        <h2>Troubleshooting Common Statistical Problems</h2>
        <p>Researchers often encounter errors that standard software handles poorly. MedStat addresses specific challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fix "Complete Separation" Errors:</strong> Standard logistic regression often fails with "complete separation" or infinite standard errors. MedStat uses Firth Logistic Regression to solve this and provide accurate estimates.</li>
            <li><strong>Analyze Small Sample Sizes:</strong> Avoid bias in small datasets (n < 50) using penalized likelihood methods designed for rare events and medical studies.</li>
            <li><strong>Observational Data Bias:</strong> Reduce confounding variables in non-randomized studies using Propensity Score Matching (PSM).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Publication-Ready Outputs</h2>
        <p>Generate results ready for academic journals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Create Forest Plots Online:</strong> Automatically generate and customize high-resolution forest plots for odds ratios and hazard ratios.</li>
            <li><strong>APA Style Tables:</strong> Get statistical tables formatted for immediate inclusion in manuscripts.</li>
            <li><strong>Calculators:</strong> Instant p-value calculation and confidence interval generation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Support for Excel and CSV</h2>
        <p>No need for complex file conversion. MedStat supports:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Analyze Excel Data Online:</strong> Upload <code>.xlsx</code> or <code>.xls</code> files directly.</li>
            <li><strong>CSV Statistics Tool:</strong> Native support for Comma Separated Values files.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Advanced Statistical Methods Available:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firth Logistic Regression:</strong> A robust method to handle small sample sizes and complete separation in binary classification problems. Particularly valuable for clinical trials and medical research where sample sizes may be limited.</li>
            <li><strong>Propensity Score Matching (PSM):</strong> Reduce selection bias in observational studies by matching treated and control subjects. Essential for improving causal inference in non-randomized medical research.</li>
            <li><strong>Survival Analysis:</strong> Professional Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox Proportional Hazards Regression for time-to-event data analysis. Critical for medical research involving patient outcomes and mortality studies.</li>
            <li><strong>Biostatistics Dashboard:</strong> User-friendly interface for complex medical data analysis with intuitive visualization and reporting capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Cox Regression:</strong> Advanced survival analysis modeling for multivariate survival data in clinical studies.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Why Choose MedStat? (Free Alternative to SPSS & Stata)</h2>
